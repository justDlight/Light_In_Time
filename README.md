It is a fully static website developed by John Weiss.
All code files are available to download and use.

This was the first website I have created for a client.

Some issues need to be discussed with client like purchasing SSL Certificate and Server location and loading times could be improved.

The website is mainly HTML with CSS code and was one of the first ever projects I built. It is designed in a Bootstrap Container.
The website is fully responsive and can be used on mobile.
